LimeSeg
=========

3D segmentation
------------------------
LimeSeg is a modular 3D image segmentation method. Based on the idea of SURFace ELements, LimeSeg resembles a highly coarse-grained simulation of a lipid membrane in which a set of particles, analogous to lipid molecules, are attracted to local image maxima.
